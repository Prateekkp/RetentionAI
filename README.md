# 📊 RetentionAI - Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

RetentionAI is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict customer churn in the telecom sector. This project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to provide actionable insights into customer retention.

## 🚀 Features

- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for seamless customer churn prediction.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained classification model for accurate churn predictions.
- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Includes categorical encoding and feature scaling.
- **Explainability & Transparency**: Displays prediction probability for better decision-making.
- **Scalable & Deployable**: Can be easily deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud or cloud services.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language  
- **Streamlit**: Frontend for the web application  
- **Scikit-learn**: Model training and preprocessing  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Pickle**: Model serialization and loading
